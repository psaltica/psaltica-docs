This repository hosts some ideas and discussions about the convergence of two distinct domains: byzantine music and information technology.

== Projects
The following project ideas are currently explored:

* a digital encoding format for byzantine musical texts
* an online database/collection of byzantine texts along with performances
* an open-source byzantine music editor and playback engine
* a set of tools to aid the learning and analysis of byzantine music
